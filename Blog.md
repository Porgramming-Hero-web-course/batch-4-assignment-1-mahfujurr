## How to handle asynchronous operations using async/await over callback/promise TypeScript.

Handling asynchronous operations in TypeScript is crucial for tasks that take time, like fetching data from an API. Asynchronous programming prevents an app from crashing while waiting for these operations to complete. It is used for callbacks and promises to manage these tasks. But callbacks can get messy with nested code known as “callback hell”, and promises, while an improvement, can still be hard to read. This is where async/await comes in handy. Async/await is a cleaner, more readable syntax for handling promises in TypeScript. It allows us to write asynchronous code in a way that looks synchronous, making it easier to follow. Using async before a function lets us use await inside it to pause the function execution until a promise is resolved or rejected. This reduces complexity, improves readability, and helps us manage asynchronous operations more effectively than with traditional methods.
